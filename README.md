## Why LLM-Pruner
    
* **Task-agnostic compression**: The compressed LLM should retains its original ability as a multi-task solver. 
* **Less training corpus**: In this work, we use only 50k publicly available corpus to post-train the LLM.  
* **Efficient compression**: 3 minutes for pruning and 3 hours for post-training. (You can make it longer)
* **Automatic structural pruning**: Pruning new LLMs with minimal human efforts (In progress).

## Features
**Supported Models:**
- [x] LLaMA-7B:  the HuggingFace Version
- [x] Vicuna-7B: Official Version

**TODO List:** 
- [ ] Code for the Official version LLaMA-7B
- [ ] Code for ChatGLM
- [ ] Code for post-training
- [ ] The tutorial of customizing the LLM-Pruner for new model: If you want to use it in your models, please try to follow this instruction

## Instruction

### QuickStart
Three steps to prune an LLM:
* <u>Discovery Stage</u>: Discover the complicated inter-dependency in LLMs and find the minimally-removable unit, **group**.
* <u>Estimation Stage</u>: Estimating the contribution of each group to the overall performance of the model and deciding which group to be pruned. 
* <u>Recover Stage</u>: Fast post-training to recover model performance.

For the evaluation, we follow <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness">lm-evaluation-harness</a>.

### Installation
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Pruning (Discovery Stage + Estimation Stage)
    
An example for LLaMA-7B pruning:
```
python hf_prune.py --pruning_ratio 0.25 --device cpu --eval_device cuda --block_wise --block_mlp_layer_start 4 --block_mlp_layer_end 30 --block_attention_layer_start 4 --block_attention_layer_end 30 --save_ckpt_log_name llama_prune --pruner_type taylor --taylor param_first --test_after_train
```

### Post-Training (Recover Stage)
Release Soon

## Quantitative Results
A brief quantitative results of LLM-Pruner of LLaMA-7B is shown in the below table. More results can be found in the paper.

| Vicuna-7B | <u>10 steps to build an ios app:</u> 1. Research and develop the idea. 2. Decide on the platform you want to use (iOS, Android, or both). 3. Create a plan and budget. 4. Hire a team of developers. 5. Design the user interface (UI). 6. Develop the user interface (UI). 7. Test and iterate on the app. 8. Submit the app to the app store. 9. Optimize the app for performance and user experience (UX). 10. Market and promote the app. | Vicuna-5.4B | <u>10 steps to build an ios app:</u> 1. Plan your app: decide what it should do, what it will look like, and what it will cost to build it. 2. Hire a developer: A good iOS developer will help you design the user interface, create the app, and make sure it’s bug-free. 3. Create a user interface: This is where the magic happens. Your app’s user interface will be designed and mocked up at this point... |
