## Why LLM-Pruner
    
* **Task-agnostic compression**: The compressed LLM should retains its original ability as a multi-task solver. 
* **Less training corpus**: In this work, we use only 50k publicly available samples (alpaca) to post-train the LLM.  
* **Efficient compression**: 3 minutes for pruning and 3 hours for post-training. (You can make it longer)
* **Automatic structural pruning**: Pruning new LLMs with minimal human effort (In progress).

#### Supported LLMs:
- [x] [LLaMA-7B HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama)

#### Release Soon:
- [ ] Code for the [Official LLaMA-7B](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)
- [ ] Code for [ChatGLM](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B)
- [ ] Code for post-training

## Instructions

### 1. Installation
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### 2. Minimal Example
```
bash script/llama_prune.sh
```
This script would compress the LLaMA-7B model with 20\% parameters pruned. All the pre-trained models, the dataset would be automatically downloaded, so you do not need to manually download the resource. After the model pruned and post-trained, the compressed model and its 

    
### 3. Step-by-step Instructions  
    
It takes three steps to prune an LLM:
* <u>Discovery Stage</u>: Discover the complicated inter-dependency in LLMs and find the minimally-removable unit, **group**.
* <u>Estimation Stage</u>: Estimate the contribution of each group to the overall performance of the model and decide which group to prune. 
* <u>Recover Stage</u>: Fast post-training to recover model performance.

After pruning and post-training, we follow <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness">lm-evaluation-harness</a> for evaluation.
    
#### 3.1 Pruning (Discovery Stage + Estimation Stage)
    
:llama: **LLaMA-7B pruning with ~20% parameters pruned:**
```
python hf_prune.py --pruning_ratio 0.25 \
      --block_wise \
      --block_mlp_layer_start 4 --block_mlp_layer_end 30 \
      --block_attention_layer_start 4 --block_attention_layer_end 30 \
      --pruner_type taylor \
      --test_after_train \
      --device cpu  --eval_device cuda \
      --save_ckpt_log_name llama_prune 
```
Arguments:
- ``Pruning Strategy``: Choose between block-wise, channel-wise, or layer-wise pruning using the respective command options: {--block_wise}, {--channel_wise}, {--layer_wise --layer NUMBER_OF_LAYERS}. For block-wise pruning, specify the start and end layers to be pruned.channel-wise pruning does not require extra arguments. For layer pruning, use --layer NUMBER_OF_LAYERS to specify the desired number of layers to be kept after pruning.
- ``Importance Criterion``: Select from l1, l2, random, or taylor using the --pruner_type argument. For the taylor pruner, choose one of the following options: vectorize, param_second, param_first, param_mix. By default, param_mix is used, which combines approximated second-order hessian and first-order gradient. If using l1, l2, or random, no extra arguments are required.
- ``Pruning Ratio``: Specifies the pruning ratio of groups. It differs from the pruning rate of parameters, as groups are removed as the minimal units.
- ``Device`` and ``Eval_device``: Pruning and evaluation can be performed on different devices. Taylor-based methods require backward computation during pruning, which may require significant GPU RAM. Our implementation uses the CPU for importance estimation. Similarly, eval_device is used to test the pruned model.

#### :llama: Vicuna Pruning

      --block_mlp_layer_start 4 --block_mlp_layer_end 30 \
      --block_attention_layer_start 4 --block_attention_layer_end 30 \
      --pruner_type taylor \

## Limitations
* Although we only used 50K data and trained for three hours, more data would definitely be better. We are testing on this.
* The current compressed model still has several issues, such as generating repetitive tokens or producing nonsensical sentences. We believe there is significant room for improvement in the quality of the compressed model.
* There are still some models for which we cannot automatically identify the mapping of indexes after concatenation and view operations. Therefore, we need to perform additional manual operations.
