# LLM-Pruner: On the structural pruning of Large Language Model

Use our LLM-Pruner to customize and prune your own LLM in any size! The paper will be released really soon! 

We give some examples here of the pruned model:

| model | Original Model | Pruned Model| 
|--|--|--|
| LLaMa | <u>The universe is the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy that exists.</u> It includes all matter and energy, whether visible or not, and in fact the whole universe is invisible. There are many theories regarding its origin and ultimate fate... | <u>The universe is the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy that exists.</u> The laws that make up physics — electrons orbiting atoms, magnets attracting other objects, planets orbiting the Sun—have been consistent over ...|

Hire a team of developers. 5. Design the user interface (UI). 6. Develop the user interface (UI). 7. Test and iterate on the app. 8. Submit the app to the app store. 9. Optimize the app for performance and user experience (UX). 10. Market and promote the app. | <u>10 steps to build an ios app:</u> 1. Plan your app: decide what it should do, what it will look like, and what it will cost to build it. 2. Hire a developer: A good iOS developer will help you design the user interface, create the app, and make sure it’s bug-free. 3. Create a user interface: This is where the magic happens. Your app’s user interface will be designed and mocked up at this point... |

## Introduction

Structural Pruning offers a potential solution to this issue by removing parameters from models. To this end, this project aims to build a straightforward and general pipeline for the pruning of LLaMA and other LLMs.
